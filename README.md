# CRYPTO DASHBOARD - Raspberry Pi Pico W
Simple but beautiful Cryptocurrency Dashboard using the Binance API.
Developed in MicroPython for Raspberry Pi Pico W
Integrated support for 2.8" TFT LCD display (ili9341), driver included with simple sources.

## INSTALL
In this case I'm using the RPi Pico W board, so you need to download the corresponding Firmware:
**https://rpf.io/pico-w-firmware
**
<br>
<br>
First of all, have the Pico W disconnected.
Then hold down the BOOTSEL button on your Pico W while connecting it to the computer via USB.
A drive will appear on the computer, copy the downloaded Firmware file to the main directory, the device will reboot.
<br>
<br>
Now it's time to open your favorite MicroPython editor, in my case I like Thonny, since it's easy and efficient.
In Thonny go to Run-->Configure Interpreter
And select MicroPhyton (Raspberry Pi Pico)
You're all set
